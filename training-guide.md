 - About 
  - This workshop is for us to learn to write automated tests for AngularJS web apps. Its about learning the protractor.
  - Protractor is an automation testing framework for AngularJS applications. It runs test against your application running in the   real browser from an end user prospective. 
 - What is our aim
  -  By the end of this workshop we should be comfertable and productive, with protractor for writing CLEAN tests.
