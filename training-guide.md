## Introduction   

Protractor is an end-to-end automation testing framework for AngularJS applications. It runs test against your application running in the real browser from an end user prospective. 

We'll learn how it works or how to write efficient automated tests from user point of view that will make our application a bug free (less bugs) application.

## Prerequisities

As protractor is an automation testing framework and by default, it uses the [Jasmine] (http://jasmine.github.io/) test framework for its testing interface which we are going to use it as well. So it will be a good idea if we have some familiarity with couple of the topics defined in the prerequisites section..
