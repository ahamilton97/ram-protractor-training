## Introduction   

Protractor is an end-to-end automation testing framework for AngularJS applications. It runs test against your application running in the real browser from an end user prospective. 

We'll learn how it works or how to write efficient automated tests from user point of view that will make our application a bug free (less bugs) application.

## Prerequisities

There are two main topics in terms of prerequisities skill, AngularJS and [Jasmine] (http://jasmine.github.io/). I set up the learning material if anyone want to go through with any of them.
